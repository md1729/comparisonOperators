/*
Comparison operators are used to compare mathematical expressions. 
The result of comparison operators is always 0 and 1. 
If the result of the comparison expression is 0, it indicates that the result of the comparison operation is false. 
If the result of the comparison expression is 1, it indicates that the result of the comparison expression is true.
== Is it equal?
< is it small?
> is it great?
>=greater than or equal to?
<=less than or equal to?
=! Isn't it equal?
